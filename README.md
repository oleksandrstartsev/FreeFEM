<div> About.
<p>Here you can find some .edp files with code for simulation of some problems in ablation theory which includes heat propagation, thermal expansion etc. If you want to run .edp file, you should previously install FreeFem++-cs 14.3 32 or FreeFem++ 3.32-1 (or later), read the FreeFEM manual and execute some .edp file  (and do not forget to press Enter button as I included delays). </p> 
<blockquote>
<p> Heatpropagation v1/heat Advanced 1.edp - is a simple program on modelling of heat propagation during laser heating. This is very simplified version without any real physical constants (real thermal capacity, etc could be easily included).
